Write a web application in Python 3 with one endpoint that accepts (x, y) coordinate values on a 2D plane.
The response is a function of the current (x, y) input as well as the previously passed values.

Response:
Iff it's possible to make a square using any of the four points plotted so far, return the 4 points formatted as a string.
Otherwise, the response is just an acknowledgement of the input.
Once a successful response is returned, further calls to the API should just return the same response.

E.g:

POST /plot
{
  "x": 1, "y": 1
}
Output:
{
  "status": "accepted"
}

POST /plot
{
  "x": 1, "y": 5
}
Output:
{
  "status": "accepted"
}

POST /plot
{
  "x": 5, "y": 1
}
Output:
{
  "status": "accepted"
}

POST /plot
{
  "x": 5, "y": 2
}
Output:
{
  "status": "accepted"
}

POST /plot
{
  "x": 5, "y": 5
}
Output:
{
  "status": "Success (1, 1) (1, 5) (5, 1) (5, 5)"
}
